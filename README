# TETRIS

## Build

Use the following commands to build TETRIS

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make


## Run

To be able to manage an application with TETRIS two steps are necessary.
First of all you need to start the TETRIS-server and give it the path
to the mappings for each program. The server executable is located in the
'bin'-directory.

After the server started up, it is now possible to run other applications and
let the TETRIS server manage them. To achieve this, one has to add the
TETRIS-client library to the program. This can be achieved by preloading the
library with the LD_PRELOAD primitive. The library is located in the 
'lib'-directory.

## Settings

### Server

See the help message of the server for information about how the server can be
tweaked.

### Client

The client reacts to two environment variables.

#### TETRIS_LOG_LEVEL

With this environmental variable you can control how much information the TETRIS
client library outputs. Possible values are DEBUG, INFO and ERROR.

#### TETRIS_PREFERRED_MAPPING

This environmental variable can be used to force the server to use one particular
mapping. The value of this variable should be the name of the preferred mapping.
